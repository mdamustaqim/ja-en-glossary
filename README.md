# Macro-based Excel Glossary

A macro-based glossary made in excel to help small scale localization.
Using a filter-based search function, the aim of this project is to help teams maintain a consistent glossary while adding the ability to search and add terms. Adapted from a TheSpreadsheetGuru guide on [How To Create A Filtering Search Box For Your Excel Data](https://www.thespreadsheetguru.com/blog/2014/11/3/filtering-search-box).

### Usage (search)

Select the language (header) to filter by, and key in search term. To trigger the filter, click 'Search'. The 'Clear' button clears any current search terms as well as any active filters.
