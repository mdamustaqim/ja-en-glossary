# Macro-based Excel Glossary

A VBA based filter for small-scale localization teams that maintain Excel-based glossaries.
Using an advanced filter based search function, the glossary exists to help teams maintain a consistent glossary with the ability to search through word genres, Japanese and English terminology, as well as explanations. Given its foundation in Excel, the aim is to do so in the Excel infrastructure so as to keep installation of anything external to a minimum, and allow for easy inspection of code for any security audit purposes.
